# Research Question: 
How does the incidence of HIV/AIDS relate to the New York State's distribution of HIV prevention resources?

Using poverty and incidence of HIV/AIDS as an indication for a need for additonal resources(we will be using HIV Testing center location, expense of using such centers, and also the location of HIV condom distribution center availability).
More importantly we will observe how has the government responded to these HIV/AIDS clusters.

# Notes
- final.ipynb is the final notebook. Please unzip to view maps/analysis.
- Would not recommend running this notebook as it does take quite a while.- 
- If the maps do not load in final.ipynb, there are html files of the maps under the same name and should be downloadable and viewable.
